# 🔐 Personal Data Leak & Password Exposure Checker

A full-stack cybersecurity web application that simulates a mini version of a breach detection service similar to Have I Been Pwned.

This tool analyzes password strength, detects exposure against a local breach database, calculates entropy, assigns risk levels, and provides actionable security recommendations — all built from scratch using secure coding practices.

---

## 🚀 Features
### 🔎 Password Analysis

* SHA-256 hashing
* Per-scan salting
* Entropy calculation
* Strength scoring (0–100)
* Risk classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)

### 🛡 Breach Detection

* Local breached password database (SHA-256 hashed)
* Unsalted hash comparison for breach lookup
* Immediate risk escalation if password found

### 🔐 Security Implementation

* No plaintext password storage
* Salted hashing for stored records
* Express rate limiting (brute force mitigation)
* Input validation & sanitization
* Helmet security headers
* Secure MongoDB logging

### 🎨 Frontend

* Clean dark UI
* Live strength bar
* Risk badge indicator
* Security recommendations display
* Loading spinner during scan

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-data-leak-checker.git
cd personal-data-leak-checker
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `/server`:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/leakchecker
```

---

### 4️⃣ Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally:

```bash
mongod
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Server

```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

---

### 6️⃣ Open in Browser

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🔐 How Security Works
### ✅ Hashing & Salting

* Breach detection uses SHA-256(password)
* Stored logs use SHA-256(password + salt)
* Prevents rainbow table attacks
* No plaintext password storage

### ✅ Entropy Calculation

Entropy is calculated using:

```
entropy = password_length × log2(character_set_size)
```

Higher entropy → harder to brute force.

### ✅ Risk Logic

* Breached → CRITICAL
* Score < 50 → HIGH
* Score < 75 → MEDIUM
* Else → LOW

### ✅ Rate Limiting

Prevents automated abuse:

* 25 requests per 15 minutes per IP
